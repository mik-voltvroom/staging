# VVOS Release Consolidation — Work Package A

Date: 2026-08-18
Canonical working branch: `rc/consolidation-v1.3.0`
Status: draft / not deployed / not merged

## Source lines

### Functional baseline
`agent/social-video-engine-v1`

Contains the public website sprint plus VV Stories / Social Video Engine. This line already includes the current Volt & Vroom public design, VV Verified, contact/conversion work, lead hardening, Social Video Engine, Firestore Social Video rules/index definitions and regression tests.

### Hardening input
`hardening/v1.2.1` / PR #14

Selected controls are being applied onto the functional baseline instead of replacing newer application files.

## Consolidated controls

- `.env.example` is fail-closed: staging + Firebase + auth required by default.
- Authentication bypass is fail-closed in code: it is allowed only when `VVOS_ENV=local`, `VVOS_DATA_MODE=demo` and `VVOS_REQUIRE_AUTH=false` are all explicit. A missing or false auth flag in staging/production therefore no longer creates a demo-owner.
- CI uses staging/Firebase/auth defaults and covers `rc/**` branches.
- repository guard, agent audit and brand audit are separate mandatory CI gates.
- `brand:audit` blocks legacy Caroutlet identity, legacy AUTOMOTIVE lockups, prohibited red identity colors and glow-style drift.
- production hardening gates are stored in `docs/PRODUCTION_HARDENING.md`.
- package metadata remains lockfile-consistent during consolidation; release naming is tracked by branch/PR until an intentional release-version bump updates both package files together.

## Conflict policy

1. Never overwrite newer website/Social Video functionality with older hardening branch files wholesale.
2. Security/release controls from hardening are applied selectively.
3. Where a hardening asset conflicts with the current Design System, the current approved brand asset wins.
4. No merge to main, staging deploy, Firebase Rules deploy, IAM/settings change or production action is part of Work Package A without explicit approval.

## Design drift decision log

### App icon
The hardening branch favicon used colors outside the current Design System palette. It was not copied. `app/icon.svg` in the canonical RC is derived from the current VV symbol and uses Paper White, Deep Ink `#0D1117` and Electric Blue `#168BFF`.

## PR #14 equivalence review

All five files changed by PR #14 were compared against the canonical RC:

| Hardening file | RC decision |
|---|---|
| `.env.example` | Equivalent fail-closed Firebase/auth defaults retained. |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Hardening gates retained; branch coverage expanded to `agent/**` and `rc/**`. |
| `docs/PRODUCTION_HARDENING.md` | P0 gates retained and extended with canonical consolidation/promotion rules. |
| `package.json` | `brand:audit` retained. Functional font dependencies from the newer website baseline retained. Package and lockfile version remain mutually consistent until the release-version decision. |
| `scripts/brand-audit.mjs` | Hardening implementation retained unchanged. |

No remaining PR #14 application file needs to be copied. The hardening branch is seven commits beyond its merge base, but its complete five-file deliverable is represented in this RC with the deliberate differences above.

## Main reconciliation

The current `main` head (`1d4607b`) contains two design commits that were created after the RC merge base. Both capabilities already exist in newer form on the canonical RC. `main` is therefore recorded as an ancestor without replacing the RC tree.

| Conflicting file | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `app/globals.css` | Keep RC. It contains the complete current public and dashboard styling; the four older logo rules from `main` are already covered by `app/public.css` and the RC globals. |
| `app/icon.svg` | Keep RC. It uses the approved VV symbol and current Paper White, Deep Ink and Electric Blue palette instead of the older placeholder mark. |
| `components/BrandLogo.tsx` | Keep RC. It extends the reusable logo with compact and dark variants required by the current public site. |
| `components/Header.tsx` | Keep RC. It contains the current website navigation, conversion CTA and mobile menu; the older `main` header would remove these routes and features. |
| `public/brand/vv-symbol.svg` | Keep RC. The artwork is content-equivalent to `main`; the conflict was caused by parallel file creation/newline history. |

This reconciliation changes no runtime file relative to the previously tested RC tree. Its purpose is to remove the stale branch conflict while preserving the newer approved design implementation.

## Demo/sample-backed endpoint inventory

Classification is based on the RC route policy with `VVOS_REQUIRE_AUTH=true` and `VVOS_DATA_MODE=firebase`.

| Surface | Exposure | RC result | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/merchant-feed` | public | Corrected: reads Firestore inventory in Firebase mode and returns `503` when unavailable; sample feed remains local-demo only. | Replace the current euro-based vehicle price model with integer cents in Commercial Core. |
| `/voorraad/[slug]` | public | Corrected: sample detail pages are not generated in Firebase mode; available vehicles are resolved server-side from Firestore. | Add the full CarCheck/VV Verified vehicle evidence model after the real inventory contract is finalized. |
| `/api/rdw/vehicle` | public | Corrected: no fabricated vehicle fallback in Firebase mode; missing adapter returns `503`. | Add provider timeout/schema validation and abuse protection. |
| `/api/portal/[token]`, `/portal/[token]` | public | Corrected: sample portal is blocked in Firebase mode. | Replace predictable sample tokens with hashed, expiring, revocable portal grants and repository-backed minimized responses. |
| `/api/public/social-videos/**` | public by design | Corrected routing drift: public read/event endpoints now bypass browser-session middleware while retaining their handler-level allow-list and same-site controls. | Add distributed event-rate limiting before high-volume launch. |
| `/api/payments/create` | authenticated | Corrected: returns `503`, `not_created`, and no payment URL until a provider transaction is actually verified. | Implement provider adapter, idempotency and eurocent amounts. |
| `/api/merchant-sync` | authenticated | Corrected: configured credentials no longer produce a fake `queued/live` result; returns `configured-unverified` and `not_started`. | Implement and verify the real Merchant transport. |
| `/api/deals`, `/api/workorders`, `/api/warranty` | authenticated | Sample-backed reads and non-persistent preview mutations remain. | Work Package B: repository-backed persistence, strict schemas and stable IDs. |
| `/api/finance/dashboard`, `/api/finance/invoices`, `/api/finance/reconcile` | authenticated | Sample-backed and euro-based preview finance remains. | Work Package B: cents migration, ledger persistence and verified reconciliation. |
| `/api/vwe/import` | secret-protected hook | Fails closed on missing/invalid secret, but still returns a demo preview when Admin Firestore is absent and accepts broad payloads. | Work Package C: strict schema, unknown-field rejection, limits and batches of at most 500 writes. |
| dashboard pages and client repositories | authenticated UI | Several views still import sample data or use the demo store. | Work Package B/C: replace by server repositories before production acceptance. |

The codebase-wide sample-data inventory also found authenticated preview surfaces for deals, finance, workshop, warranty and dashboard views. They are not publicly reachable under the RC auth policy, but remain production blockers until repository-backed implementations replace them.

Public sample/business data is therefore blocked on the identified public production surfaces in Firebase mode. This does not make the internal Commercial Core production-ready; the authenticated preview endpoints above remain explicit P0 blockers.

## P0 validation before Work Package A can close

- [x] clean locked dependency install
- [x] dependency audit high-severity gate
- [x] repository guard
- [x] agent audit
- [x] brand audit
- [x] TypeScript typecheck
- [x] complete Vitest suite
- [x] Next.js production build
- [x] compare remaining unique PR #14 changes against canonical RC
- [x] identify demo/sample-backed public endpoints for Work Package B/C
- [x] restrict authentication bypass to an explicit local demo environment
- [x] mark PR #4 / #6 / #14 as superseded only after canonical RC proves equivalent or better

## Validation evidence

The authentication-boundary head `078d400b9a3afefb7490e6a3d04ea1a52463b469` passed the complete local quality suite: repository guard, agent audit, brand audit, TypeScript, 70 Vitest tests and the staging/Firebase/auth production build. GitHub Actions then passed the clean lockfile install, production dependency audit and the same quality/build gates in both the push run (`32126872745`, 1m26s) and pull-request run (`32126876266`, 1m40s).

The Actions runner emitted one non-blocking maintenance annotation: `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-node@v4` still target the deprecated Node 20 action runtime and were forced onto Node 24. This does not change the application test runtime, which remains explicitly configured as Node 22, but the action majors should be reviewed when GitHub publishes the supported upgrade path.

## Promotion rule

Only an exact tested SHA may move forward to staging acceptance. This branch is not production-ready merely because code has been consolidated.

## Work Package A closure

PR #4, PR #6 and PR #14 were each given an explicit supersession comment and closed without merge on 2026-08-18. Their branches and commit history remain available for audit. Draft PR #15 is the only canonical release candidate. Work Package B now continues on the same RC branch; see `docs/WORK_PACKAGE_B.md`.
